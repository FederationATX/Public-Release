The free book 'Federation ATX' describes the following:

1 ) Archeological and geographic evidence of a direct connection between a Native American tribe and NGC-2264, a cluster of stars in the constellation Monoceros.
2 ) A novel theory regarding the Da Vinci paintings ‘Salvator Mundi’  and ‘The Last Supper’ which suggests that the artist presents a clear reference to a camera, a telescope, or both in an attempt to provide observable scientific support for the evidence described above.
3 ) A novel theory which describes a straightforward underlying unity between all major world religions based on specific evidence provided by Da Vinci and others.
4 ) A plan to create a cirriculum of  Open Source (Creative Commons 4 International) lesson plans for grades K-12 to enable Native American and Canadian students to graduate high school and move directly to MIT level course work in preparation to enter NASA’s astronaut training program or to become scientists focused on the natural world and space exploration.
5 ) A plan to create community programs on Native American and Canadian Indian reservations that treats each reservation as a model space colony - enabling all reservation residents to participate in a multi-national effort to conduct research around organizing and feeding off world colonies.
Following in the footsteps of NASA and ESA, all materials will be released under an Open Source 
(Creative Commons 4 International) license - enabling anyone anywhere in the world to download both our cirriculum and our model space colony framework at no cost.
